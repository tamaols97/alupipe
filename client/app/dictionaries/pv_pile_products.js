        PV Pipe shall supply pipes according to Customer Requirement which is based on the optimal production process. Our quality is guaranteed by following exact manufacturing and quality control procedures as well as controlled by our quality management system complied API Q1 and ISO 9001.


        SAWL Pipe is the primary product of PV PIPE and is produced using a high-quality steel plate as the key input factor. Steel plates are produced by qualified suppliers, which are rigorously evaluated by PV PIPE based on meeting all technical and quality requirements. Steel plates are formed into a round shape, welded by submerged arc welding technology, and then mechanically expanded into the final dimensional tolerance.
        
        PV PIPE also offers steel pipes with various sizes and specifications to meet all possible customer requests
