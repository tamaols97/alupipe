            II. Advantages of Alcotop
            Heat resistance: 3 times more than material made of steel.
            Extremely large sound absorption capacity, helping us feel quieter on rainy and windy days, not feeling noisy when it rains like other steel or corrugated iron roofs.
            Waterproofing ability: the corrosion resistance of Alcotop panels is high and has the ability to adapt to the weather, withstand the impact at the temperature background from -50 degrees Celsius -> 80 degrees Celsius.
            Light, durable, easy to work materials: The weight of the plate is only half the weight of a uniform aluminum sheet of the same thickness and equivalent stiffness. Easily cut or shape them into different shapes, suitable for many types of modern architecture, it is this feature that can help us easy construction such as sawing, cutting, drilling holes or bending without worry about peeling or scratching the aluminum plate.
            III. Applications
            Commonly used in basic architectural constructions
            Application in modern industry
            Used in interior design, home decoration
            Production and installation according to the actual requirements of customers

            I. What is FR ACP sheet?
            In recent years, in most of the advanced and developed countries in the world, FR ACP sheets are increasingly popular and widely used because of their superior aesthetics and fire-resistant performance for buildings with high fire resistance. strict requirements on compliance with fire protection regulations. Accordingly, the structure of a FR ACP fireproof aluminum sheet will include: The outermost layer is a protective film, followed by a color paint layer, top aluminum layer, glue layer, fireproof plastic core with MgO2 composition, layer. glue and aluminum bottom layer.
            
            2. Fireproof certifications achieved by FR ACP ALCOTOP
            Nearly 10 years of developing the product line of fireproof aluminum panels, Alcotop has obtained countless different certificates from many reputable testing units in the world, such as ISO 9001 quality certificate, fireproof certificate. NFPA 285 – USA   from USA, PSB 2019 PSB – Singapore from Singapore and Korean standard KS A2 Core test. and fireproof certifications of Vietnam Institute of IBST VN test report
